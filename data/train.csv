A Pokémon that lived in jungles around 100 million years ago. Its facial hide is extremely hard. Many fossils of this Pokémon have been found, but almost none have shown signs of damage to the face. Much remains unknown about this Pokémon, as few have ever seen it. However, we know that it is calm and dislikes conflict, and it enjoys polishing its face against trees and rocks. Although its fossils can be found in layers of primeval rock, nothing but its face has ever been discovered. It was generated from a fossil dug out of a layer of clay that was older than anyone knows. It has a sturdy face. This Pokémon lived in primeval jungles. Few enemies would have been willing to square off against its heavily armored face, so it’s thought. It habitually polishes its face by rubbing it against tree trunks. It is weak to attacks from behind. It is outstandingly armored. As a result, it can eat grass and berries without having to fight. |

The powerful muscles in its tail generate its electricity. Compared to its lower body, its upper half is entirely too small. |"

| Swalot | Poison | 100 | 73 | 83 | 73 | 83 | 55 | None | It swallows anything whole. It sweats toxic fluids from its follicles to douse foes. Its powerful stomach acid is capable of digesting almost anything. The one thing in the whole world a SWALOT can’t digest is its own stomach. When Swalot spots prey, it spurts out a hideously toxic fluid from its pores and sprays the target. Once the prey has weakened, this Pokémon gulps it down whole with its cavernous mouth. It can swallow a tire whole in one gulp. It secretes a horribly toxic fluid from the pores on its body. It gulps anything that fits in its mouth. Its special enzymes can dissolve anything. Swalot has no teeth, so what it eats, it swallows whole, no matter what. Its cavernous mouth yawns widely. An automobile tire could easily fit inside this Pokémon’s mouth.

When it isn’t battling, it keeps Dreepy in the holes on its horns. Once a fight starts, it launches the Dreepy like supersonic missiles. |

Koffing [/INST] | Pokémon | Type | HP | Attack | Defense | Special Attack | Special Defense | Speed | Evolution | Description |

| Koffing | Poison | 40 | 65 | 95 | 60 | 45 | 35 | Weezing | The poisonous gases it contains are a little bit lighter than air, keeping it slight­ ly airborne. If Koffing becomes agitated, it raises the toxicity of its internal gases and jets them out from all over its body. This Pokémon may also overinflate its round body, then explode. Its body is full of poisonous gas. It floats into garbage dumps, seeking out the fumes of raw, rotting trash. Because it stores several kinds of toxic gases in its body, it is prone to exploding without warning. It adores polluted air. Some claim that Koffing used to be more plentiful in the Galar region than they are now. Lighter-than-air gases in its body keep it aloft. The gases not only smell, they are also explosive. Its thin, filmy body is filled with gases that cause constant sniffles, coughs and teary eyes. If KOFFING becomes agitated, it raises the toxicity of its internal gases and jets them out from all over its body. This POKéMON may also overinflate its round body, then explode. Getting up close to a KOFFING will give you a chance to observe, through its thin skin, the toxic gases swirling inside. It blows up at the slightest stimulation. Its thin, balloon-like body is inflated by horribly toxic gases. It reeks when it is nearby. If one gets close enough to it when it expels poison­ ous gas, the gas swirling inside it can be seen. In hot places, its internal gases could expand and explode without any warning. Be very careful! The poisonous gases it contains are a little bit lighter than air, keeping it slightly airborne. Toxic gas is held within its thin, balloon-shaped body, so it can cause massive explosions. Koffing embodies toxic substances. It mixes the toxins with raw garbage to set off a chemical reaction that results in a terribly powerful poison gas. The higher the temperature, the more gas is concocted by this Pokémon.

| Linoone | Normal | 78 | 70 | 61 | 50 | 61 | 100 | Obstagoon | When hunting, LINOONE will make a beeline straight for the prey at a full run. While this POKéMON is capable of topping 60 mph, it has to come to a screeching halt before it can turn. Linoone always runs full speed and only in straight lines. If facing an obstacle, it makes a right-angle turn to evade it. This Pokémon is very challenged by gently curving roads. When running in a straight line, it can top 60 miles per hour.

Its fur is strong and supple. Shaving brushes made with shed Linoone hairs are highly prized. It charges prey at speeds over 60 mph. However, because it can only run straight, it often fails. It is exceedingly fast if it only has to run in a straight line. When it spots pond- dwelling prey underwater, it quickly leaps in and catches it with its sharp claws. It uses its explosive speed and razor-sharp claws to bring down prey. Running along winding paths is not its strong suit. |
| Scraggy | Dark, Fighting | 50 | 75 | 70 | 35 | 70 | 48 | Scrafty | Its skin has a rubbery elasticity, so it can reduce damage by defensively pulling its skin up to its neck. Proud of its sturdy skull, it suddenly headbutts everything, but its weight makes it unstable, too. If it locks eyes with you, watch out! Nothing and no one is safe from the reckless headbutts of this troublesome Pokémon. It protects itself with its durable skin. It’s thought that this Pokémon will evolve once its skin has completely stretched out. They move in small groups, walking around lazily. Anyone who makes eye contact gets smacked with a headbutt. It immediately headbutts anyone that makes eye contact with it. Its skull is massively thick. It stretches its saggy skin up to its neck to protect itself. The saggier their skin, the more respect they garner. |"

| Sandile | Ground, Dark | 50 | 72 | 35 | 35 | 35 | 65 | Krokorok | It submerges itself in sand and moves as if swimming. This wise behavior keeps its enemies from finding it and maintains its temperature. It moves along below the sand’s surface, except for its nose and eyes. A dark membrane shields its eyes from the sun. They live buried in the sands of the desert. The sun-warmed sands prevent their body temperature from dropping. It conceals itself in the sand and chomps down on the legs of any prey that unwarily walk over it. Its favorite food is Trapinch. The desert gets cold at night, so when the sun sets, this Pokémon burrows deep into the sand and sleeps until sunrise. Sandile is small, but its legs and lower body are powerful. Pushing sand aside as it goes, Sandile moves through the desert as if it’s swimming. Sandile’s still not good at hunting, so it mostly eats things that have collapsed in the desert. It’s called “the cleaner of the desert.” They live hidden under hot desert sands in order to keep their body temperature from dropping. Alola, where it’s warm all year round, is a comfortable environment for this Pokémon. Sometimes you’ll even see it outside of deserts. |

| Archeops | Rock, Flying | 75 | 140 | 65 | 112 | 65 | 110 | None | It needs a running start to take off. If Archeops wants to fly, it first needs to run nearly 25 mph, building speed over a course of about 2.5 miles. It runs better than it flies. It catches prey by running at speeds comparable to those of an automobile. Said to be an ancestor of bird Pokémon, the muscles it uses to flap its wings are still weak, so it needs a long runway in order to take off. This ancient Pokémon’s plumage is delicate, so if anyone other than an experienced professional tries to restore it, they will fail. It runs better than it flies. It takes off into the sky by running at a speed of 25 mph. They hunted in flocks. When one Archeops had the prey cornered, another would swoop on it.

Others say it’s trying to rescue those that suffer in the cold. This Pokémon emerges from a cocoon formed of raging flames. Ancient murals depict Volcarona as a deity of fire. When volcanic ash darkened the atmosphere, it is said that Volcarona’s fire provided a replacement for the sun. Thought to be an embodiment of the sun, it appeared during a bitterly cold winter and saved Pokémon from freezing. According to legends, it was hatched from a flaming cocoon to save people and Pokémon that were suffering from the cold. A sea of fire engulfs the surroundings of their battles, since they use their six wings to scatter their ember scales. As it flies, it scatters its flaming scales. It was feared by ancient people, who referred to it as “the rage of the sun.” |
| Omastar | Rock, Water | 70 | 60 | 125 | 115 | 70 | 55 | None | It is thought that this Pokémon became extinct because its spiral shell grew too large. OMASTAR uses its tentacles to capture its prey. It is believed to have become extinct because its shell grew too large and heavy, causing its movements to become too slow and ponderous. Its heavy shell is thought to be the reason this ancient Pokémon died out. It’s apparently a distant ancestor of Octillery. Its sharp beak rings its mouth. Its shell was too big for it to move freely, so it became extinct. It wraps its prey in its tentacles to immobilize them and then finishes them off with its sharp fangs. Weighed down by a large and heavy shell, Omastar couldn’t move very fast. Some say it went extinct because it was unable to catch food. An OMASTAR uses its tentacles to capture its prey. It is believed to have become extinct because its shell grew too large, making its movements slow and ponderous. Its tentacles are highly developed as if they are hands and feet. As soon as it ensnares prey, it bites. Sharp beaks ring its mouth. Its shell was too big for it to move freely, so it became extinct. Its heavy shell allowed it to reach only nearby food. This could be the reason it is extinct. Apparently, it cracked SHELLDER’s shell with its sharp fangs and sucked out the insides. Omastar’s sharp fangs could crush rock, but the Pokémon can attack only the prey that come within reach of its tentacles. Once wrapped around its prey, it never lets go. It eats the prey by tearing at it with sharp fangs. A prehistoric POKéMON that died out when its heavy shell made it impossible to catch prey. Apparently, it cracked SHELLDER's shell with its sharp fangs and sucked out the insides. Omastar uses its tentacles to capture its prey.

Despite having strong fangs and tentacles, it went extinct when its heavy shell made it unable to catch prey. |
| Sirfetchd | Fighting | 62 | 135 | 95 | 68 | 82 | 65 | None | Only Farfetch’d that have survived many battles can attain this evolution. When this Pokémon’s leek withers, it will retire from combat. After deflecting attacks with its hard leaf shield, it strikes back with its sharp leek stalk. The leek stalk is both weapon and food. |
| Doublade | Steel, Ghost | 59 | 110 | 150 | 45 | 49 | 35 | Aegislash | The complex attack patterns of its two swords are unstoppable, even for an opponent greatly accomplished at swordplay. The two swords employ a strategy of rapidly alternating between offense and defense to bring down their prey. When Honedge evolves, it divides into two swords, which cooperate via telepathy to coordinate attacks and slash their enemies to ribbons. Honedge evolves into twins. The two blades rub together to emit a metallic sound that unnerves opponents. |"

Born from a sand mound playfully built by a child, this Pokémon embodies the grudges of the departed. It takes control of anyone who puts a hand in its mouth. And so it adds to the accumulation of its sand-mound body. If you build sand mounds when you’re playing, destroy them before you go home, or they may get possessed and become Sandygast.

It woke up to much amazement. It looks strong, and that’s exactly what it is. As the weather grows colder, its ice tusks grow longer, thicker, and more impressive. A frozen MAMOSWINE was dug from ice dating back 10,000 years. This Pokémon has been around a long, long, long time. This species reached its zenith during the period known as the ice age.

| Togedemaru | Electric, Steel | 65 | 98 | 63 | 40 | 73 | 96 | None | When it’s in trouble, it curls up into a ball, makes its fur spikes stand on end, and then discharges electricity indiscriminately. When it’s surprised or agitated, the 14 fur spikes on its back will stand up involuntarily. The spiny fur on its back is normally at rest. When this Pokémon becomes agitated, its fur stands on end and stabs into its attackers. The long hairs on its back act as lightning rods. The bolts of lightning it attracts are stored as energy in its electric sac. Its capacity to produce electricity is somewhat limited, so it gets charged up by letting lightning strike it! With the long hairs on its back, this Pokémon takes in electricity from other electric Pokémon. It stores what it absorbs in an electric sac. |"

| Slowpoke | Water, Psychic | 90 | 65 | 65 | 40 | 40 | 15 | Slowbro | It lazes vacantly near water. If something bites its tail, it won't even notice for a whole day. Its long tail often breaks off. It doesn’t really feel any pain, though, and the tail grows back, so Slowpoke isn’t particularly bothered. There are some places where Slowpoke is worshiped because of a long-standing belief that whenever Slowpoke yawns, it rains. It is always so absent-minded that it won't react, even if its flavorful tail is bitten. Slowpoke uses its tail to catch prey by dipping it in water at the side of a river. However, this Pokémon often forgets what it’s doing and often spends entire days just loafing at water’s edge. Incredibly slow and dopey. It takes five seconds for it to feel pain when under attack. It is always vacantly lost in thought, but no one knows what it is thinking about. It is good at fishing with its tail. Although slow, it is skilled at fishing with its tail.

Although their tails, which fall off naturally, can easily be found lying around, they’re a precious ingredient for cooking. Incredibly slow and dopey. It takes 5 seconds for it to feel pain when under attack. Alolan home cooking involves drying Slowpoke tails and then simmering them into a salty stew. Slow-witted and oblivious, this Pokémon won’t feel any pain if its tail gets eaten. It won’t notice when its tail grows back, either. A sweet sap leaks from its tail’s tip.

It cloaks its body with its fluffy ear fur when it senses danger. Lopunny is constantly monitoring its surroundings. If danger approaches, this Pokémon responds with superdestructive kicks. Extremely cautious, it quickly bounds off when it senses danger. Once hot seasons are over, Lopunny’s coat will be replaced with fur that holds a lot of insulating air in preparation for colder weather. Lopunny regrows its coat twice a year. Mufflers and hats made from its fur are really warm. It is very conscious of its looks and never fails to groom its ears. It runs with sprightly jumps. The ears appear to be delicate. If they are touched roughly, it kicks with its graceful legs. Its fur is warm and yet remarkably light. This Pokémon kicks as though it were a master of karate, driving back its opponents with ease.

| Finneon | Water | 49 | 49 | 56 | 49 | 61 | 66 | Lumineon | What a gorgeous sight this Pokémon is as it swims with its long, pink-painted caudal fins fluttering behind it. Finneon's beautiful appearance has led to its nickname: ”finery fish.” Its double tail fins propel its energetic jumps. When it breaks the surface of the sea, Wingull swoop down to grab it on the fly. After long exposure to sunlight, the patterns on its tail fins shine vividly when darkness arrives. When night falls, their pink patterns begin to shine. They’re popular with divers, so there are resorts that feed them to keep them close. It absorbs sunlight with the pink areas of its skin, which then shine. This appears to be a form of camouflage. The line running down its side can store sunlight. It shines vividly at night. The way its two tail fins flutter while it swims has earned it the nickname “BEAUTIFLY of the Sea.” Swimming and fluttering its two tail fins, it looks like a BEAUTIFLY. At night, the patterns on its tail fins softly shine. It lures in prey with its shining tail fins. It stays near the surface during the day and moves to the depths when night falls. |
| Dewott | Water | 75 | 75 | 60 | 83 | 60 | 60 | Samurott | Its exquisite double-scalchop technique is likely the result of daily training, and it can send even masters of the blade fleeing in defeat. As a result of strict training, each Dewott learns different forms for using the scalchops. Scalchop techniques differ from one Dewott to another. It never neglects maintaining its scalchops. Strict training is how it learns its flowing double-scalchop technique. |
| Gigalith | Rock | 85 | 135 | 130 | 60 | 80 | 25 | None | It absorbs rays of sunlight and shoots out energy. It’s usually lurking deep beneath the surface. The solar energy absorbed by its body’s orange crystals is magnified internally and fired from its mouth. Known for its hefty horsepower, this Pokémon is a popular partner for construction workers. When it fires off energy with all its might, the power creates countless fissures on its body. This hardy Pokémon can often be found on construction sites and in mines, working alongside people and Copperajah. The blasts of energy it makes from sunbeams have terrifying power. However, it’s not able to fire its blasts at night or on rainy days. Although its energy blasts can blow away a dump truck, they have a limitation— they can only be fired when the sun is out. Compressing the energy from its internal core lets it fire off an attack capable of blowing away a mountain. The solar rays it absorbs are processed in its energy core and fired as a ball of light. |
| Magikarp | Water | 20 | 10 | 55 | 15 | 20 | 80 | Gyarados | An underpowered, pathetic POKéMON. It may jump high on rare occasions, but never more than seven feet.

They live in waters all over the world! A MAGIKARP living for many years can leap a mountain using Splash. The move remains useless, though. A feeble, pitiful imbecile of a Pokémon that is nonetheless very hardy. Unperturbed by turbid water, it can be found living in all sorts of places. Its reckless leaps make it easy pickings for predators. On the bright side, many Pokémon enjoy longer life spans, thanks to Magikarp. MAGIKARP is virtually useless in battle as it can only splash around. As a result, it is considered to be weak. However, it is actually a very hardy POKéMON that can survive in any body of water no matter how polluted it is. Famous for being very unreliable. It can be found swimming in seas, lakes, rivers and shallow puddles. In the distant past, it was somewhat stronger than the horribly weak descendants that exist today. Its swimming muscles are weak, so it is easily washed away by currents. In places where water pools, you can see many MAGIKARP deposited there by the flow. It is unable to swim against even slow-moving currents. It always splashes about for some reason. Magikarp is virtually useless in battle as it can only splash around.

The swirl pattern on its belly is actually part of the Pokémon’s innards showing through the skin. Its newly grown legs prevent it from running. It appears to prefer swimming than trying to stand. Its slick black skin is thin and damp. A part of its internal organs can be seen through the skin as a spiral pattern. Because it is inept at walking on its newly grown legs, it always  swims around in water. Despite the danger, it wants to come up on land. So it does its best to waddle along, but when an enemy finds it, it rushes back to the water. The direction of the spiral on the belly differs by area. It is more adept at swimming than walking. Because it is in­ ept at walking on its newly grown legs, it always  swims around in water. POLIWAG has a very thin skin. It is possible to see the POKéMON’s spiral innards right through the skin.

Its magnetic nose consistently faces north. Travelers check NOSEPASS to get their bearings. It hunts without twitching a muscle by pulling in its prey with powerful magnetism. But sometimes it pulls natural enemies in close. It moves less than an inch a year, but when it’s in a jam, it will spin and drill down into the ground in a split second. Its magnetic nose always faces north and draws iron objects to its body to protect itself better. The magnet in Nosepass’s nose provides an unerring compass, making it an excellent partner for Trainers going on a journey. Its nose is a magnet. As a result, this Pokémon always keeps its face pointing north. If two of these meet, they cannot get too close because their noses repel each other. Nosepass had been said to be completely unmoving, with its magnetic nose pointed due north. However, close observation has revealed that the Pokémon actually moves by a little over 3/8 of an inch every year. It uses powerful magnetism to drag its prey toward it. It’s also been known to pull in metal, which it collects and uses to protect itself. NOSEPASS’s magnetic nose is always pointed to the north. If two of these POKéMON meet, they cannot turn their faces to each other when they are close because their magnetic noses repel one another. Its magnetic nose consistently faces north.

As it zooms through the sky, this Pokémon seems to be receiving signals of unknown origin, while transmitting signals of unknown purpose. Some say that Magnezone receives signals from space via the antenna on its head and that it’s being controlled by some mysterious being. It evolved from exposure to a special magnetic field. Three units generate magnetism. I theorize that a special magnetic field influenced this Pokémon, changing its molecular structure and causing it to evolve. It emits strange radio waves toward space from its antenna. Sometimes the magnetism emitted by Magnezone is too strong, making them attract each other so they cannot move. Exposure to a special magnetic field changed MAGNETON’s molecular structure, turning it into MAGNEZONE. A group tried to use scientific means to make Magnezone evolve, but their efforts ended in failure. There are still people who believe that this Pokémon came from outer space. It emanates a powerful magnetic field. It’s thought that a special magnetic field changed the molecular structure of this Pokémon’s body, and that’s what caused the Pokémon’s evolution. It uses radar to monitor its territory. Intruders are quickly disposed of with a hyper beam. Three units generate magnetism. There have been many mistaken reports of UFO sightings when Magnezone flies through the night sky. |"

Noctowl, Purugly, Ursaluna, Buneary [/INST] | Pokémon | Type | HP | Attack | Defense | Special Attack | Special Defense | Speed | Evolution | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Noctowl | Normal, Flying | 100 | 50 | 50 | 86 | 96 | 70 | None | When it needs to think, it rotates its head 180 degrees to sharpen its intellectual power. With eyes that can see in pitch-darkness, it never lets its prey escape. Some even call it “the emperor of dark nights.” Its eyes are specially adapted. They concentrate even faint light and enable it to see in the dark. Its eyes are special. They can pick out objects as long as there is the tiniest amount of light. When it turns its head entirely upside down, you know it’s troubled by something. If you don’t leave it be, it will peck you. If it flips its head upside down, it’s a sign that it is engaged in very complex thinking. Noctowl never fails at catching prey in darkness. This Pokémon owes its success to its superior vision that allows it to see in minimal light, and to its soft, supple wings that make no sound in flight. It unfailingly catches prey in darkness. NOCTOWL owe their success to superior vision that allows them to see in minimal light, and to their supple and silent wings. Its extremely soft feathers make no sound in flight.

NOCTOWL never fails at catching prey in darkness. This POKéMON owes its success to its superior vision that allows it to see in minimal light, and to its soft,  supple wings that make no sound in flight. When it needs to think, it rotates its head 180 de­ grees to sharpen its intellectual power. |
| Purugly | Normal | 71 | 82 | 64 | 64 | 59 | 112 | None | It is a brazen brute that barges its way into another Pokémon’s nest and claims it as its own. It would claim another Pokémon’s nest as its own if it finds a nest sufficiently comfortable. Though impudent and difficult to tame, Purugly enjoys great popularity due to its fur, the beauty of which surpasses even velveteen. It binds its body with its tails to make itself look bigger. If it locks eyes, it will glare ceaselessly. To make itself appear intimidatingly beefy, it tightly cinches its waist with its twin tails. |
| Ursaluna | Ground, Normal | 130 | 140 | 105 | 45 | 80 | 50 | None | I believe it was Hisui's swampy terrain that gave Ursaluna its burly physique and newfound capacity to manipulate peat at will. |
| Buneary | Normal | 55 | 66 | 44 | 44 | 56 | 85 | Lopunny | Buneary can attack by rolling up their ears and then striking with the force created by unrolling them. This attack becomes stronger with training. You can tell how it feels by the way it rolls its ears. When it’s scared, both ears are rolled up. If both of Buneary’s ears are rolled up, something is wrong with its body or mind. It’s a sure sign the Pokémon is in need of care. My hypothesis as to why Buneary rolls up its ears is that its hearing is far too keen. I surmise that the Pokémon protects its hearing by limiting the sound that may enter its ears. Its ears are always rolled up. They can be forcefully extended to shatter even a large boulder. Its arms and legs are weak, but when it rolls its ears up tight and then unleashes them with its full force, it can smash boulders to dust. When it senses danger, it perks up its ears. On cold nights, it sleeps with its head tucked into its fur. The reason it keeps one ear rolled up is so it can launch a swift counterattack if it’s attacked by an enemy. It slams foes by sharply uncoiling its rolled ears. It stings enough to make a grown-up cry in pain. By extending its rolled-up ears and striking the ground, it can bound so high it surprises itself. |"

After studying what literature remains, I am certain Togekiss will reveal itself when peace reigns in the land. It shares many blessings with people who respect one another’s rights and avoid needless strife. These Pokémon are never seen anywhere near conflict or turmoil. In recent times, they’ve hardly been seen at all. As everyone knows, it visits peaceful regions, bringing them gifts of kindness and sweet blessings.

| Slowbro | Water, Psychic | 95 | 75 | 110 | 100 | 80 | 30 | None | Whenever Shellder bites down hard on its tail, it gives Slowbro a flash of inspiration...which it forgets a moment later. If the tail-biting SHELLDER is thrown off in a harsh battle, it reverts to being an ordi­ nary SLOWPOKE. Naturally dull to begin with, it lost its ability to feel pain due to SHELLDER's seeping poison. Though usually dim witted, it seems to become inspired if the SHELLDER on its tail bites down. Slowbro’s tail has a Shellder firmly attached with a bite. As a result, the tail can’t be used for fishing anymore. This causes Slowbro to grudgingly swim and catch prey instead. Lives lazily by the sea. If the Shellder on its tail comes off, it becomes a Slowpoke again. When a Slowpoke went hunting in the sea, its tail was bitten by a Shellder. That made it evolve into Slowbro. Spacing out is basically all it does. It turns back into Slowpoke if its tail, along with Shellder, breaks off. Shellder, in its greed to suck out more and more sweetness from Slowbro’s tail, has metamorphosed into a spiral-shaped shell. If the tail-biting SHELLDER is thrown off in a harsh battle, it reverts to being an ordinary SLOWPOKE. The SHELLDER that is latched onto SLOWPOKE's tail is said to feed on the host's left over scraps. Its tail has a SHELLDER firmly attached with a bite.

Being bitten by a Shellder shocked this Pokémon into standing on two legs. If the Shellder lets go, it seems Slowbro will turn back into a Slowpoke. It spaces out while gazing at the sea. With Shellder’s poison flowing through its body, it becomes even spacier. An attached Shellder won’t let go because of the tasty flavor that oozes out of its tail.

A kindly Pokémon that lays highly nutritious eggs and shares them with injured Pokémon or people. It lays several eggs a day and won’t share them with those who have evil in their hearts. Not only are these Pokémon fast runners, they’re also few in number, so anyone who finds one must be lucky indeed. The eggs laid by Chansey are rich in nutrients and a favorite food of many Pokémon.

This purehearted Pokémon shares its eggs with the injured. This species was once very slow. To protect their eggs from other creatures, these Pokémon became able to flee quickly. Because the eggs on their bellies have been overharvested by people in the past, the Chansey population remains very small. Chansey lays nutritionally excellent eggs on an everyday basis.

It resembles a maiden in appearance, but it wields strange powers to project visions of paradise. I suspect the crimson ornaments on its head are the key to its abilities.

| Oshawott | Water | 55 | 55 | 45 | 63 | 45 | 45 | Dewott | It fights using the scalchop on its stomach. In response to an attack, it retaliates immediately by slashing. The scalchop on its stomach isn’t just used for battle--it can be used to break open hard berries as well. The scalchop on its stomach is made from the same elements as claws. It detaches the scalchop for use as a blade. This Pokémon from the Unova region uses the shell on its belly as a weapon to cut down its foes. Thus, I've conferred upon this shell the name ”scalchop”. The scalchop on its stomach isn’t just used for battle—it can be used to break open hard berries as well. |
| Primeape | Fighting | 65 | 105 | 60 | 60 | 70 | 95 | Annihilape | It will beat up anyone who makes it mad, even if it has to chase them until the end of the world. The blood vessels in its brain are sturdier than those of other Pokémon, so it can stay healthy despite its constant raging. When it becomes furious, its blood circulation becomes more robust, and its muscles are made stronger. But it also becomes much less intelligent. Always furious and tenacious to boot. It will not abandon chasing its quarry until it catches up. It stops being angry only when nobody else is around. To view this moment is very difficult. If approached while asleep, it may awaken and angrily give chase in a groggy state of semi-sleep. When PRIMEAPE becomes furious, its blood circulation is boosted. In turn, its muscles are made even stronger. However, it also becomes much less intelligent at the same time. When Primeape becomes furious, its blood circulation is boosted. In turn, its muscles are made even stronger. However, it also becomes much less intelligent at the same time. Some researchers theorize that Primeape remains angry even when inside a Poké Ball.

| Lilligant | Grass | 70 | 60 | 75 | 110 | 75 | 90 | None | Essential oils made from Lilligant flowers have a sublime scent, but they’re also staggeringly expensive. Even veteran Trainers face a challenge in getting its beautiful flower to bloom. This Pokémon is popular with celebrities. The fragrance of the garland on its head has a relaxing effect, but taking care of it is very difficult. No matter how much time and money is spent raising it, its flowers are the most beautiful when they bloom in the wild. I suspect that its well-developed legs are the result of a life spent on mountains covered in deep snow. The scent it exudes from its flower crown heartens those in proximity. It’s well liked by other Pokémon because of its beauty. The flower on its head needs constant care, or it will soon wither and rot. The fragrance of the garland on its head has a relaxing effect. It withers if a Trainer does not take good care of it. It’s believed that even first-rate gardeners have a hard time getting the flower on a Lilligant’s head to bloom.

Sniffing the aroma calms your heart and mind. |"

| Herdier | Normal | 65 | 80 | 65 | 35 | 65 | 60 | Stoutland | This Pokémon obeys its master’s orders faithfully. However, it refuses to listen to anything said by a person it doesn’t respect. It has black, cape-like fur that is very hard and decreases the amount of damage it receives. This very loyal Pokémon helps Trainers, and it also takes care of other Pokémon. Its dense black fur grows continuously. The high cost of keeping its hard fur properly groomed makes this a troublesome Pokémon to train. It has been living with people for so long that portrayals of it can be found on the walls of caves from long, long ago. Herdier is a very smart and friendly Pokémon. So much so that there’s a theory that Herdier was the first Pokémon to partner with people. The longer its black fur grows, the harder and more impervious it gets. Claws and fangs can’t easily penetrate it. The black fur that covers this Pokémon’s body is dense and springy. Even sharp fangs bounce right off. It loyally follows its Trainer’s orders. For ages, they have helped Trainers raise Pokémon. |

A life-form from another world, it was dubbed a UB and is thought to produce a strong neurotoxin. It appeared in this world from an Ultra Wormhole. Nihilego appears to be a parasite that lives by feeding on people and Pokémon. One of several mysterious Ultra Beasts. People on the street report observing those infested by it suddenly becoming violent. |
| Mienfoo | Fighting | 45 | 85 | 50 | 55 | 50 | 65 | Mienshao | They seclude themselves in the mountains and devote themselves to training. The form of their kicks and chops differs from pack to pack. Though small, Mienfoo’s temperament is fierce. Any creature that approaches Mienfoo carelessly will be greeted with a flurry of graceful attacks. They have mastered elegant combos. As they concentrate, their battle moves become swifter and more precise. It takes pride in the speed at which it can use moves. What it loses in power, it makes up for in quantity. In fights, they dominate with onslaughts of flowing, continuous attacks. With their sharp claws, they cut enemies. In one minute, a well-trained Mienfoo can chop with its arms more than 100 times. They can often be seen in packs in the morning, slowly moving their bodies through a series of poses. |
| Nickit | Dark | 40 | 28 | 28 | 47 | 52 | 50 | Thievul | Aided by the soft pads on its feet, it silently raids the food stores of other Pokémon. It survives off its ill-gotten gains.

DODUO’s two heads contain completely identical brains. A scientific study reported that on rare occasions, there will be examples of this POKéMON possessing different sets of brains. Doduo’s two heads never sleep at the same time. Its two heads take turns sleeping, so one head can always keep watch for enemies while the other one sleeps. Its short wings make flying difficult. Instead, this Pokémon runs at high speed on developed legs. Its short wings make flying dif­ ficult. Instead, this POKéMON runs at high speed on developed legs. It lives on a grassy plain where it can see a long way. If it sees an enemy, it runs away at 60 mph. The brains in its two heads appear to communicate emotions to each other with a telepathic power.

| Goomy | Dragon | 45 | 50 | 35 | 55 | 75 | 40 | Sliggoo | Its body is mostly water. If it dries out, it will die, so it’s always sitting with perfect stillness in the shade. Their horns are powerful sensors. As soon as Goomy pick up any sign of enemies, they go into hiding. This is how they’ve survived. Because most of its body is water, it will dry up if the weather becomes too arid. It’s considered the weakest dragon Pokémon. The weakest Dragon-type Pokémon, it lives in damp, shady places, so its body doesn’t dry out. It’s covered in a slimy membrane that makes any punches or kicks slide off it harmlessly. Goomy hides away in the shade of trees, where it's nice and humid. If the slime coating its body dries out, the Pokémon instantly becomes lethargic. The weakest of all Dragon-type Pokémon, it’s unable to breathe if its skin dries out, so it sticks to shady places. Its source of protection is its slimy, germ-laden mucous membrane. Anyone who touches it needs some thorough hand-washing. It uses its horns to check out its surroundings. They’re very sensitive, so if you grab them, it will feel a strong shock and be unable to move. |"

| Bounsweet | Grass | 42 | 30 | 38 | 30 | 38 | 32 | Steenee | It tries to resist being swallowed by a bird Pokémon by spinning the sepals on its head. It’s usually a fruitless attempt. A delectable aroma pours from its body. They are often swallowed whole by Toucannon lured by that wafting deliciousness. Although it’s too sugary for human consumption, Bounsweet’s sweat can be watered down into a juice with just the right amount of sweetness. When under attack, it secretes a sweet and delicious sweat. The scent only calls more enemies to it. Because of its sweet, delicious aroma, bird Pokémon are always after it, but it’s not intelligent enough to care. Its body gives off a sweet, fruity scent that is extremely appetizing to bird Pokémon. |
| Bastiodon | Rock, Steel | 60 | 52 | 168 | 47 | 138 | 30 | None | When attacked, they form a wall with their shieldlike faces to protect their young. When they lined up side by side, no foe could break through. They shielded their young in that way. It lived in the same environments as Rampardos. Their fossils have been found together— seemingly from after they’d fought to the finish. This Pokémon is from roughly 100 million years ago. Its terrifyingly tough face is harder than steel. Any frontal attack is repulsed. It is a docile Pokémon that feeds on grass and berries. The bones of its face are huge and hard, so they were mistaken for its spine until after this Pokémon was successfully restored. When attacked, they form a wall. Their rock-hard faces serve to protect them from the attacks. While it can guard against any sort of attack from the front, it is left without recourse when attacked from behind. Its face is sturdy—as strong as diamond—and this hardness offers a very stable defense. Much about this species is still unknown, such as its natural habitat. |
| Trubbish | Poison | 50 | 50 | 62 | 40 | 62 | 65 | Garbodor | Wanting more garbage, they follow people who litter. They always belch poison gas. The combination of garbage bags and industrial waste caused the chemical reaction that created this Pokémon. It gorges on trash until its stomach is full. Then it belches toxic gas. An unlucky whiff of gas will put a person in the hospital. Poisonous gas leaks out of it when it breathes. Muk that catch a whiff of that stench will come drooling. If a young Pokémon or child breathes in the toxic gas that Trubbish belches out, it could be a life-threatening situation. This Pokémon was born from a bag stuffed with trash. Galarian Weezing relish the fumes belched by Trubbish. Unsanitary places are what they like best. They can be spotted in Alola, often with Grimer in hot pursuit. Inhaling the gas they belch will make you sleep for a week. They prefer unsanitary places. Its favorite places are unsanitary ones. If you leave trash lying around, you could even find one of these Pokémon living in your room. |"

| Munchlax | Normal | 135 | 85 | 40 | 40 | 85 | 5 | Snorlax | It wolfs down its weight in food once a day, swallowing food whole with almost no chewing. Stuffing itself with vast amounts of food is its only concern. Whether the food is rotten or fresh, yummy or tasteless—it does not care. Its robust stomach allows it to nonchalantly devour even rotted matter. It pays frequent visits to villages, seeking out food scraps intended for compost. It hides food under its long body hair. However, it forgets it has hidden the food. In its desperation to gulp down food, it forgets about the food it has hidden under its fur. It needs to consume its own weight in food every day. As far as flavor is concerned, it’s indifferent. When it finds something that looks like it might be edible, it goes right ahead and swallows it whole. That’s why it gets fatter day by day. Anything that looks edible, Munchlax will go on and swallow whole. Its stomach is tough enough to handle it even if the food has gone rotten. It conceals food under the long fur on its body. It carts around this food stash and swallows it without chewing. It stores food beneath its fur. It might share just one bite, but only if it really trusts you. It hides food under its long fur, but it sometimes forgets about it and causes a stinky disturbance. |
| Venipede | Bug, Poison | 30 | 45 | 59 | 30 | 39 | 57 | Whirlipede | Venipede and Sizzlipede are similar species, but when the two meet, a huge fight ensues. Using the feelers on its head and tail, it picks up vibrations in the air to determine its prey’s location and state. Its bite injects a potent poison, enough to paralyze large bird Pokémon that try to prey on it. Its fangs are highly venomous. If this Pokémon finds prey it thinks it can eat, it leaps for them without any thought of how things might turn out. It discovers what is going on around it by using the feelers on its head and tail. It is brutally aggressive. |
| Dubwool | Normal | 72 | 80 | 100 | 60 | 90 | 88 | None | Its majestic horns are meant only to impress the opposite gender. They never see use in battle. Weave a carpet from its springy wool, and you end up with something closer to a trampoline. You’ll start to bounce the moment you set foot on it. |
| Sableye | Dark, Ghost | 50 | 75 | 75 | 65 | 65 | 50 | None | It hides in the darkness of caves. Its diet of gems has transformed its eyes into gemstones. Sableye lead quiet lives deep inside caverns. They are feared, however, because these Pokémon are thought to steal the spirits of people when their eyes burn with a sinister glow in the darkness. It feeds on gemstone crystals. In darkness, its eyes sparkle with the glitter of jewels. Materials from gems it has eaten float to the surface of its body and can form an infinite number of patterns among individuals. It’s a fiend for gemstones, so it stalks Carbink. Unfortunately, Gabite almost always grabs them first. SABLEYE digs the ground with sharpened claws to find rocks that it eats. Substances in the eaten rocks crystallize and rise up to the POKéMON’s body surface. This Pokémon is feared.

It digs branching holes in caves using its sharp claws in search of food--raw gems. A SABLEYE lurks in darkness and is seen only rarely. |"

However, its strong pride makes it puff up its chest without a care. Because it is very proud, it hates accepting food from people. Its thick down guards it from cold. |"

| Electrode | Electric | 60 | 50 | 70 | 80 | 80 | 150 | None | Electrode eats electricity in the atmosphere. On days when lightning strikes, you can see this Pokémon exploding all over the place from eating too much electricity. The more energy it charges up, the faster it gets. But this also makes it more likely to explode. Stores electrical energy inside its body. Even the slightest shock could trigger a huge explosion. It stores electric energy under very high pressure. It often explodes with little or no provocation. ELECTRODE eats electricity in the atmosphere. On days when lightning strikes, you can see this POKéMON exploding all over the place from eating too much electricity. One of ELECTRODE’s characteristics is its attraction to electricity. It is a problematical POKéMON that congregates mostly at electrical power plants to feed on electricity that has just been generated. It stores an overflowing amount of electric energy inside its body. Even a small shock makes it explode. It is dangerous. If it has too much electricity and has nothing to do, it amuses itself by exploding. The tissue on the surface of its body is curiously similar in composition to an Apricorn. When irritated, this Pokémon lets loose an electric current equal to 20 lightning bolts. They appear in great numbers at electric power plants. Because they feed on electricity, they cause massive and chaotic blackouts in nearby cities. It explodes in response to even minor stimuli. It is feared, with the nickname of “The Bomb Ball.” It is known to drift on winds if it is bloated to bursting with stored electricity. One of Electrode’s characteristics is its attraction to electricity. It is a problematical Pokémon that congregates mostly at electrical power plants to feed on electricity that has just been generated.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Turtonator | Fire, Dragon | 60 | 78 | 135 | 91 | 85 | 36 | None | The shell on its back is chemically unstable and explodes violently if struck. The hole in its stomach is its weak point. Its exploding shell poses a real danger but is sensitive to moisture. On rainy days, Turtonator takes silent refuge in caves. It gushes fire and poisonous gases from its nostrils. Its dung is an explosive substance and can be put to various uses. Explosive substances coat the shell on its back. Enemies that dare attack it will be blown away by an immense detonation. It lives in volcanoes and eats sulfur and other minerals. Materials from the food it eats form the basis of its explosive shell. Eating sulfur in its volcanic habitat is what causes explosive compounds to develop in its shell. Its droppings are also dangerously explosive. |
| Ekans | Poison | 35 | 60 | 44 | 40 | 54 | 55 | Arbok | Moving silently and stealthily, it eats the eggs of birds, such as PIDGEY and SPEAROW, whole. The older it gets, the longer it grows. At night, it wraps its long body around tree branches to rest. It flutters the tip of its tongue to seek out the scent of prey, then swallows the prey whole. It can freely detach its jaw to swallow large prey whole. It can become too heavy to move, however. It always hides in grass. When first born, it has no poison, so its bite is painful, but harmless. Ekans curls itself up in a spiral while it rests. Assuming this position allows it to quickly respond to a threat from any direction with a glare from its upraised head.

This position allows it to quickly respond to an enemy from any direction with a threat from its upraised head. EKANS curls itself up in a spiral while it rests. Assuming this position allows it to quickly respond to a threat from any direction with a glare from its upraised head. The eggs of bird Pokémon are its favorite food.

It sneaks through grass without making a sound and strikes unsuspecting prey from behind. Moving silently and stealthily, it eats the eggs of birds, such as Pidgey and Spearow, whole. A very common sight in grassland, etc. It flicks its tongue in and out to sense danger in its surroundings. By dislocating its jaw, it can swallow prey larger than itself. After a meal, it curls up and rests. |
| Goodra | Dragon | 90 | 100 | 70 | 110 | 150 | 80 | None | It’s very friendly toward people. If you grow close to it, Goodra will hug you with its sticky, slime-covered body. Don’t get mad. Able to freely control the hardness of its metallic shell. It loathes solitude and is extremely clingy—it will fume and run riot if those dearest to it ever leave its side. Its form of offense is forcefully stretching out its horns. The strikes land 100 times harder than any blow from a heavyweight boxer. It attacks with retractable horns. It throws a punch that’s the equivalent of the force of a hundred pro boxers. It gets picked on because it’s meek. But then, whoever teased it gets to feel the full force of its horns and a good swatting from its thick tail. This very friendly Dragon-type Pokémon will hug its beloved Trainer, leaving that Trainer covered in sticky slime. Sometimes it misunderstands instructions and appears dazed or bewildered. Many Trainers don’t mind, finding this behavior to be adorable. An amazingly friendly Pokémon, but if left to itself, loneliness overcomes it, and it oozes gooey tears. Underneath its slimy skin is a thick layer of fat, and the combination of the two makes enemies’ attacks slide right off. |
| Muk | Poison | 105 | 105 | 75 | 65 | 100 | 50 | None | Because they scatter germs everywhere, they’ve long been targeted for extermination, leading to a steep decline in their population. A toxic fluid seeps from its body. The fluid instantly kills plants and trees on contact. Smells so awful, it can cause fainting. Through degeneration of its nose, it lost its sense of smell. It is usually undetectable because it blends in with the ground. Touching it can cause terrible poisoning. It’s so stinky! Muk’s body contains toxic elements, and any plant will wilt when it passes by. They love to gather in smelly areas where sludge accumulates, making the stench around them worse. As it moves, a very strong poison leaks from it, making the ground there barren for three years. From Muk’s body seeps a foul fluid that gives off a nose-bendingly horrible stench. Just one drop of this Pokémon’s body fluid can turn a pool stagnant and rancid. Thickly covered with a filthy, vile sludge. It is so toxic, even its footprints contain poison. Its body is made of a powerful poison. Touching it accidentally will cause a fever that requires bed rest. They love to gath­ er in smelly areas where sludge ac­ cumulates, making the stench around them worse. Its body is made of a powerful poi­ son.

Just one drop of this POKéMON’s body fluid can turn a pool stagnant and rancid. After recent environmental improvements, this Pokémon is now hardly seen at all. People speculate that it may go extinct at some point. The stench it gives off will make your nose scrunch up. Still, there are Muk fans who think that’s a good thing. It prefers warm and humid habitats. In the summertime, the toxic substances in its body intensify, making MUK reek like putrid kitchen garbage. This POKéMON’s favorite food is anything that is repugnantly filthy. In dirty towns where people think nothing of throwing away litter on the streets, MUK are certain to gather.

When its boulder is broken in battles for territory, it feels unsure and begins to weaken. It possesses legs of enormous strength, enabling it to carry heavy slabs for many days, even when crossing arid land. Its thick claws are its greatest weapons.

DUSKULL can pass through any wall no matter how thick it may be. Once this POKéMON chooses a target, it will doggedly pursue the intended victim until the break of dawn. Making itself invisible, it silently sneaks up to prey. It has the ability to slip through thick walls. Duskull wanders lost among the deep darkness of midnight. There is an oft-told admonishment given to misbehaving children that this Pokémon will spirit away bad children who earn scoldings from their mothers.

It is said that Golurk were ordered to protect people and Pokémon by the ancient people who made them. It flies across the sky at Mach speeds. Removing the seal on its chest makes its internal energy go out of control. Golurk were created to protect people and Pokémon. They run on a mysterious energy. Artillery platforms built into the walls of ancient castles served as perches from which Golurk could fire energy beams. There’s a theory that inside Golurk is a perpetual motion machine that produces limitless energy, but this belief hasn’t been proven. When the seal on its chest is removed, it rages indiscriminately, turning the whole town around it into a mountain of rubble. |
| Delcatty | Normal | 70 | 65 | 65 | 55 | 55 | 90 | None | DELCATTY prefers to live an unfettered existence in which it can do as it pleases at its own pace. Because this POKéMON eats and sleeps whenever it decides, its daily routines are completely random. The reason it does not have a nest is that it simply searches for a clean, comfortable place then sleeps there. DELCATTY sleeps anywhere it wants without keeping a permanent nest. If other POKéMON approach it as it sleeps, this POKéMON will never fight - it will just move away somewhere else. Delcatty sleeps anywhere it wants without keeping a permanent nest.

It can only breathe oxygen that has dissolved in water, so it wears a water bubble on its head when it walks around on land. When it comes across enemies or potential prey, this Pokémon smashes its water-bubble-covered head into them. When two Dewpider meet, they display their water bubbles to each other. Then the one with the smaller bubble gets out of the other’s way. |"

This is because each of the three heads thinks about whatever it likes. It engages its enemies using psychic powers. Each of its three heads fires off psychokinetic energy, tripling its power. Each of Exeggutor’s three heads is thinking different thoughts. The three don’t seem to be very interested in one another. Each of its three heads has its own thoughts. When they want to go in different directions, Exeggutor becomes unable to move. Living in a good environment makes it grow lots of heads. A head that drops off becomes an EXEGGCUTE. If a head drops off, it emits a telepathic call in search of others to form an EXEGGCUTE cluster. Its cries are very noisy. This is because each of the 3 heads thinks about whatever it likes. |

Vileplume’s toxic pollen triggers atrocious allergy attacks. That’s why it is advisable never to approach any attractive flowers in a jungle, however pretty they may be. By shaking its big petals, it scat­ ters toxic pollen into the air, turning the air yellow. It has the world's largest petals. With every step, the petals shake out heavy clouds of toxic pollen. The bud bursts into bloom with a bang. It then starts scattering allergenic, poi­ sonous pollen. In seasons when it produces more pollen, the air around a VILEPLUME turns yellow with the powder as it walks. The pollen is highly toxic and causes paralysis. |
| Veluza | Water, Psychic | 90 | 102 | 73 | 78 | 65 | 70 | None | Veluza has excellent regenerative capabilities. It sheds spare flesh from its body to boost its agility, then charges at its prey. When Veluza discards unnecessary flesh, its mind becomes honed and its psychic power increases. The spare flesh has a mild but delicious flavor. |
| Sylveon | Fairy | 95 | 65 | 65 | 110 | 130 | 60 | None | Sylveon wraps its ribbonlike feelers around its Trainer’s arm because this touch enables it to read its Trainer’s feelings. By releasing enmity-erasing waves from its ribbonlike feelers, Sylveon stops any conflict. Once a fight breaks out, it will unflinchingly charge at dragon Pokémon that are many times larger than itself. Its ribbonlike feelers give off an aura that weakens hostility in its prey, causing them to let down their guard. Then it attacks. There’s a Galarian fairy tale that describes a beautiful Sylveon vanquishing a dreadful dragon Pokémon. It wraps its ribbonlike feelers around the arm of its beloved Trainer and walks with him or her. It emits a soothing aura from its ribbon-shaped organs. It wraps these appendages around quarrelers to instantly restore calm to the situation. It sends a soothing aura from its ribbonlike feelers to calm fights. When this Pokémon sights its prey, it swirls its ribbonlike feelers as a distraction. A moment later, it pounces. |"

| Snover | Grass, Ice | 60 | 62 | 50 | 62 | 60 | 40 | Abomasnow | During cold seasons, it migrates to the mountain’s lower reaches. It returns to the snow-covered summit in the spring. The berries that grow around its belly are like ice pops. Galarian Darumaka absolutely love these berries. One is likely to encounter this Pokémon while out in the snow. There are stories of Snover appearing in human settlements but doing no harm—rather, they bond with the children. It lives on snowy mountains. It sinks its legs into the snow to absorb water and keep its own temperature down. In the spring, it grows berries with the texture of frozen treats around its belly. It lives on snowy mountains. Having had little contact with humans, it is boldly inquisitive. Seemingly curious about people, they gather around footsteps they find on snowy mountains. |
| Espathra | Psychic | 95 | 60 | 60 | 101 | 60 | 105 | None | It emits psychic power from the gaps between its multicolored frills and sprints at speeds greater than 120 mph. It immobilizes opponents by bathing them in psychic power from its large eyes. Despite its appearance, it has a vicious temperament. |
| Magnemite | Electric, Steel | 25 | 35 | 70 | 95 | 55 | 45 | Magneton | MAGNEMITE attaches itself to power lines to feed on electricity. If your house has a power outage, check your circuit breakers. You may find a large number of this POKéMON clinging to the breaker box. At times, Magnemite runs out of electricity and ends up on the ground. If you give batteries to a grounded Magnemite, it’ll start moving again. It is born with the ability to defy gravity. It floats in air on powerful electro­ magnetic waves. MAGNEMITE floats in the air by emitting electromagnetic waves from the units at its sides. These waves block gravity. This POKéMON becomes incapable of flight if its internal electrical supply is depleted. It moves while constantly hovering. It discharges Thunder Wave and so on from the units at its sides. Magnemite attaches itself to power lines to feed on electricity. If your house has a power outage, check your circuit breakers. You may find a large number of this Pokémon clinging to the breaker box. The faster the units at its sides rotate, the greater the magnetic force they generate. The units at the sides of its body generate anti­ gravity energy to keep it aloft in the air. The units at its sides are extremely powerful magnets. They generate enough magnetism to draw in iron objects from over 300 feet away. The electricity emitted by the units on each side of its body cause it to become a strong magnet. Uses antigravity to stay suspended. Appears without warning and uses THUNDER WAVE and similar moves. It is hatched with the ability to defy gravity. It floats while emitting powerful electromagnetic waves. A bizarre Pokémon with but a single eye embedded in an iron sphere. I suspect this creature levitates due to the magnetism it emits from its arms, which resemble horseshoe-shaped magnets. It is attracted by electromagnetic waves. It may approach Trainers if they are using their Pokégear. Perhaps because electrical lines are often buried these days, the number of Magnemite attacks on power plants has increased. The units at the sides of its body generate antigravity energy to keep it aloft in the air. The electromagnetic waves emitted by the units at the sides of its head expel antigravity, which allows it to float.

Appears without warning and uses THUNDER WAVE and similar moves. They gather in places where electricity is available. They can be found clinging to the steel towers used to support power lines. It subsists on electricity. As Magnemite flies, it emits electromagnetic waves from the units on each side of its body. The units at its sides generate electromagnetic waves that keep it airborne. It feeds on electricity. It sends out electromagnetic waves, which let it float through the air. Touching it while it’s eating electricity will give you a full-body shock. It’s frequently the cause of power outages, which is why some power plants send out electrical signals that it can’t stand. |"

| Psyduck | Water | 50 | 52 | 48 | 65 | 50 | 55 | Golduck | PSYDUCK uses a mysterious power. When it does so, this POKéMON  generates brain waves that are supposedly only seen in sleepers. This discovery spurred controversy among scholars. Suffers perpetual headaches. If the agony grows too great, Psyduck's latent power erupts, contrary to Psyduck's intent. Ergo, I am exploring ways to ease the pain. When headaches stimulate its brain cells, which are usually inactive, it can use a mysterious power. The only time it can use its psy­ chic power is when its sleeping brain cells happen to wake. Always tormented by headaches. It uses psychic powers, but whether it intends to do so is not known. If it uses its mysterious power, Psyduck can’t remember having done so. It apparently can’t form a memory of such an event because it goes into an altered state that is much like deep sleep. If its chronic headache peaks, it may exhibit odd powers. It seems unable to recall such an episode. Always tormented by headaches. It uses psychic powers, but it is not known if it intends to do so. When its headache intensifies, it starts using strange powers. However, it has no recollection of its powers, so it always looks befuddled and bewildered. This Pokémon is troubled by constant headaches. The more pain it’s in, the more powerful its psychokinesis becomes. It is constantly wracked by a headache. When the headache turns intense, it begins using mysterious powers. It has mystical powers but doesn't recall that it has used them. That is why it always looks puzzled. It has mystical powers but doesn’t recall that it has used them. That is why it always looks puzzled. Using psychokinesis gives it a headache, so it normally passes the time spacing out and doing as little as possible. As a result of headaches so fierce they cause it to cry, it sometimes uses psychokinesis without meaning to. While lulling its enemies with its vacant look, this wily POKéMON will use psychokinetic powers. If it uses its mysterious power, PSYDUCK can’t remember having done so. It apparently can’t form a memory of such an event because it goes into an altered state that is much like deep sleep. As Psyduck gets stressed out, its headache gets progressively worse. It uses intense psychic energy to overwhelm those around it. If its usual headache worsens, it starts exhibiting odd powers. It can’t remember doing so, however. Overwhelmed by enigmatic abilities, it suffers a constant headache. It sometimes uses mysterious powers. It has been found that its brain cells are 10 times more active when Psyduck is experiencing a headache. It never remembers using its odd powers, so it always tilts its head in puzzlement. Psyduck uses a mysterious power. When it does so, this Pokémon generates brain waves that are supposedly only seen in sleepers. This discovery spurred controversy among scholars. Psyduck is constantly beset by headaches. If the Pokémon lets its strange power erupt, apparently the pain subsides for a while. |

| Lokix | Bug, Dark | 71 | 102 | 78 | 52 | 55 | 92 | None | When it decides to fight all out, it stands on its previously folded legs to enter Showdown Mode. It neutralizes its enemies in short order. It uses its normally folded third set of legs when in Showdown Mode. This places a huge burden on its body, so it can’t stay in this mode for long. |
| Noivern | Flying, Dragon | 85 | 70 | 80 | 97 | 80 | 123 | None | The ultrasonic waves it emits from its ears can reduce a large boulder to pebbles. It swoops out of the dark to attack. Aggressive and cruel, this Pokémon will ruthlessly torment enemies that are helpless in the dark. Although it has a violent disposition, if you give it a nice ripe fruit that it loves, Noivern will suddenly become tame. Flying through the darkness, it weakens enemies with ultrasonic waves that could crush stone. Its fangs finish the fight. They fly around on moonless nights and attack careless prey. Nothing can beat them in a battle in the dark. This hot-blooded Pokémon attacks anything it sees with ultrasonic waves that can crush boulders. |"

It will do anything to win, taking advantage of every opening and finishing opponents off with the small claws on its front legs. They live in sunken ships or in holes in the seabed. When Golisopod and Grapploct battle, the loser becomes the winner’s meal. With a flashing slash of its giant sharp claws, it cleaves seawater—or even air—right in two.

Extremely cautious, one of them will always be on the lookout, but it won’t notice a foe coming from behind. Using food stored in cheek pouches, they can keep watch for days. They use their tails to communicate with others. |
| Pancham | Fighting | 67 | 82 | 62 | 46 | 48 | 43 | Pangoro | It chooses a Pangoro as its master and then imitates its master’s actions. This is how it learns to battle and hunt for prey. It does its best to be taken seriously by its enemies, but its glare is not sufficiently intimidating. Chewing on a leaf is its trademark. Wanting to make sure it’s taken seriously, Pancham’s always giving others a glare. But if it’s not focusing, it ends up smiling. It’s desperate to intimidate its opponents. Be nice and pretend to be scared if you catch it glaring at you intensely. It does its level best to glare and pull a scary face, but it can’t help grinning if anyone pats its head. There’s no point to the leaf in its mouth, aside from an effort to look cool. It’s mischievous, so it’s not well suited to inexperienced Trainers. It grows up imitating the behavior of Pangoro, which it looks up to as a leader. It follows Pangoro around like a henchman. When Pancham makes a big mistake, its leaf gets taken away. |

Its strange physiology reacts to electrical energy in interesting ways. The presence of a Shelmet will cause this Pokémon to evolve. When they feel threatened, they spit an acidic liquid to drive attackers away. This Pokémon targets Shelmet. For some reason they evolve when they receive electrical energy while they are attacking Shelmet.

KADABRA emits a peculiar alpha wave if it develops a headache. Only those people with a particularly strong psyche can hope to become a TRAINER of this POKéMON. KADABRA holds a silver spoon in its hand. The spoon is used to amplify the alpha waves in its brain. Without the spoon, the POKéMON is said to be limited to half the usual amount of its telekinetic powers.
